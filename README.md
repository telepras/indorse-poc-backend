What is this POC about?
=========================

This is the repository for the Indorse POC, which will be released in the first week of August 2017.

Unlike traditional platforms such as LinkedIn, Indorse aims to give back ownership of the data to you, as the user, and allow you to profit from sharing your skills and activities on the platform.
